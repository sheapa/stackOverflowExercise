Exercise 2: Design a StackOverflow Post

Design a class called Post. This class models a StackOverflow post. It should have properties
for title, description and the date/time it was created. We should be able to up-vote or down-vote
a post. We should also be able to see the current vote value. In the main method, create a post,
up-vote and down-vote it a few times and then display the the current vote value.
In this exercise, you will learn that a StackOverflow post should provide methods for up-voting
and down-voting. You should not give the ability to set the Vote property from the outside,
because otherwise, you may accidentally change the votes of a class to 0 or to a random
number. And this is how we create bugs in our programs. The class should always protect its
state and hide its implementation detail.
